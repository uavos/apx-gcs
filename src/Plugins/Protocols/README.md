# Protocols abstraction

The protocol, which is used to communicate to unit is defined by a plugin.

The interface is defined in [ApxData](https://github.com/uavos/apx-gcs/tree/main/src/lib/ApxData/Protocols) lib.

See the [`PApx`](https://github.com/uavos/apx-gcs/tree/main/src/Plugins/Protocols/PApx) protocol implementation for an example.
