  - name: sns
    title: Sensors
    desc: Read only data sources, measured by sensors from physical parameters.
          Used as inputs to estimators. Never sent through telemetry stream.

    - name: nav
      references: sns-nav
      title: Navigation
      desc: Sensors used for vehicle navigation and controls.
            Used as input for position and attitude estimators and
            for filters to supply aerodynamic controls.

    - name: env
      references: sns-env
      title: Environment
      desc: Environmental sensors.
            Data used as inputs for filters to estimate vehicle state
            and safety conditions.





  - name: ctr
    title: Controls
    desc: Controls for vehicle drives and servos.
          Published by regulators.

      title: Navigation
      desc: Controls used for vehicle stabilization.
            Data published by controllers for aerodynamic controls.

    - name: env
      references: ctr-env
      title: Environment
      desc: Environmental controls.
            Data generated by internal logic or uplink from GCS.





  - name: state
    references: state
    title: State
    desc: Current vehicle state.
          Estimated values of sensors and current navigator status.
    contents:

    - name: nav
      references: state-nav
      title: Navigation
      desc: Estimated data used for vehicle regulators.
            Filtered sensor data.

    - name: env
      references: state-env
      title: Environment
      desc: Processed data of current vehicle conditions.
            Can be overriden by GCS uplink.





  - name: cmd
    references: cmd
    title: Commands
    desc: Commanded values.
          Received from the GCS or provided by navigator as commands for
          regulators.
    contents:

    - name: nav
      references: cmd-nav
      title: Navigation
      desc: Commanded values generated by controllers.

    - name: env
